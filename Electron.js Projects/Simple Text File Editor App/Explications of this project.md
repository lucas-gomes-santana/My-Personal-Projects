INFORMATION ABOUT MY PROJECT!

1 - This simple text file editing app built with Electron.js is being developed by a student, which means it has some bugs and only basic features, such as opening existing files and saving changes made to them.

2 - I will make the source code for this project available on my GitHub. If you have more knowledge about development with Electron.js than I do, I kindly ask you to leave comments on my repository suggesting websites where I can find free courses on the subject or leave comments in the discussion section about this project. I’d be very grateful if you could do this :-).

3 - I will try to make future improvements to this app. However, it will take some time because I still need to study more about the logic of JavaScript commands that utilize the features of the Electron framework.

4 - “Did you code all this by yourself?” Answer: No. Since this is my first project where the code isn’t run in a terminal but instead in an application interface, and considering that I’m still learning, I used ChatGPT to get the JavaScript code (the back-end of the project). And no, IT WAS NOT EASY to make this project (even though it’s a very basic and simple app) just because I used AI. The chat isn’t very precise when generating code. Many times, I submitted a wrong code to be corrected, and it returned an even more incorrect version hahaha. I had to resubmit the same code several times, and I had to solve some of the bugs that appeared by myself. But I’ll study more about the logic behind these codes and try to enhance my skills with this framework to the fullest.

5 - If you don’t know how to program or have never used Electron.js, follow the instructions below to install Electron.js in a folder on your computer so you can use this app:

INSTRUCTIONS: Run these commands in sequence in your computer terminal:

1 - mkdir ProjectFolder (You can choose another name for the folder where you want to host Electron).

2 - cd ProjectFolder (Or the alternative name you chose).

3 - npm install electron --save-dev.

4 - Start the app using the following command in your code editor terminal: npm start.
